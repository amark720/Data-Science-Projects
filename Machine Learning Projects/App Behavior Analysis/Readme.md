# APP BEHAVIOUR ANALYSIS

## Problem Statement
The project was aimed whether the customer will keep using the app (after the app was charged some money) based on his previous subscription and with the help of various features provided for each user using logistic regression, so that greater marketing efforts can go into trying to **convert** those users to Paid Users.

## Model Used
The case study utilises Logistic Regression Model from the Scikit Learn Library, which is evaluated using K-Fold Cross Validation & Grid Search, and later undergoes Feature Selection, to maintain a balance between the Accuracy and Number of Input Features.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit Learn
