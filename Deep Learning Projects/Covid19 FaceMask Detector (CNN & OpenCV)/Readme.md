# Covid19 FaceMask Detector using CNN & OpenCV.


<div align= "center">
  <h4>Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images as well as in video streams.</h4>

## :innocent: Motivation
In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Also, the absence of large datasets of __‘with_mask’__ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging. 


## :star: Features

This system can be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

## :file_folder: Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded here - [Click to Download](https://www.kaggle.com/prithwirajmitra/covid-face-mask-detection-dataset)

This dataset consists of __1006 images__ belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 500 images__
*	__without_mask: 606 images__



## 🚀 Installation
1. Download the files in this repository and extract them.
2. Run Face_Mask_Detection.ipynb file first using Google colab:-
<br>
Colab File link - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rX32L-EHFvdtulPbVlwllBve8bdKwC_m#scrollTo=pO9U0q_KNDsF

3. Running the above .ipynb file will generate Model.h5 file.
4. Download that Model.h5 file from Colab to local Machine.
5. Now Run Mask.py file
6. Done.

Note: Make sure that you're using the same Tensorflow and Keras version on your local machine that you're using on Google Colab otherwise you'll get error.

## :key: Results

#### Our model gave 92% accuracy for Face Mask Detection after training via <code>tensorflow==2.3.0</code><br>
The model can further be Improved by doing parameter tuning.
