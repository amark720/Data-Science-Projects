# Introduction to Keras for Duilding Deep Learning Models

This Python Notebook focuses on a specific sub-field of machine learning called **predictive modeling.**

Within predicitve modeling is a speciality or another sub-field called **deep learning.**

This notebook includes deep learning models with a library called Keras. 

>**Predictive modeling** is focused on developing models that make accurate predictions at the expense of explaining why predictions are made. 

You and I don't need to be able to write a binary classification model. We need to know how to use and interpret the results of the model. 

Just Download and open the .ipynb file and everything is explained there in a detailed manner.<br>
Alternatively you can visit the link given below where the notebook can be accessed through Kaggle.
