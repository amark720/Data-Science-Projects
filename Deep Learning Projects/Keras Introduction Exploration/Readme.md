Within predicitve modeling is a speciality or another sub-field called **deep learning.**

This notebook includes deep learning models with a library called Keras. 

>**Predictive modeling** is focused on developing models that make accurate predictions at the expense of explaining why predictions are made. 

You and I don't need to be able to write a binary classification model. We need to know how to use and interpret the results of the model. 

Just Download and open the .ipynb file and everything is explained there in a detailed manner.
