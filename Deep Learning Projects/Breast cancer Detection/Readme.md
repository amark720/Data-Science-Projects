# Breast Cancer Prediction
> Predicts whether the type of breast cancer is Malignant or Benign

## Focus of the Project
#### > To predict if a breast cancer is Malignant or Benign using Image Dataset as well as Numerical Data
#### > Apply ML and DL Models to predict the severity of the Breast-Cancer

## About Project:

Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. When cancers are found early, they can often be cured. 
There are some devices that detect the breast cancer but many times they lead to false positives, which results 
is patients undergoing painful, expensive surgeries that were not even necessary. These type of cancers are called 
**benign** which do not require surgeries and we can reduce these unnecessary surgeries by using Machine Learning. 
I have taken the dataset of the previous breast cancer patients and train the model to predict whether the cancer is **benign** or **malignant**. These predictions will help doctors to do surgeries only when the cancer is malignant, thus reducing the unnecessary surgeries for woman. 

For building the project I have used Wisconsin Breast cancer data which has 569 rows of which 357 are benign and 212 are malignant. 
The data is prepossessed and scaled. I have trained with Random forest Classifier gives best accuracy of 95.0%.

## Languages Used:

  * Python: language
  * NumPy: library for numerical calculations
  * Pandas: library for data manipulation and analysis
  * SkLearn: library which features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms
