## Celebrity Information Searching Web Application
"Celebrity Information Searching web Application" takes Celebrity name as input and will reply with the brief information regarding that celebrity including their Date of Birth. Along with that it will also give 5 major events happened around the DOB of that celebrity in the world. We have used Streamlit for web app interface and OpenAI API and Langchain for fetching results using several in-code prompts.

#### Improvements
* Here we've used a very less prompts for fetching the results. So, the app can be improved further by adding more prompts regarding various information about the celebrity.
* We can enhance it more by adding an image upload button where user can upload an image of a celebrity and the app will first analyse the image and fetch the name of celebrity who is in that image and after that using LangChain and OpenAI app will reply the user with the inforamtion of that celebrity.
* We can also try to add a feature of storing the history of user search.
