# (Deep Learning) Car-Brand-Classifier
"Car Brand Classifier App" Classifies cars of different brands using transfer learning technique Resnet-50. Here Transfer learning recognizes car brands of 3 different brands(i.e. Audi/Lamborghini/Mercedes). For the training set we used 80 images and for validation set 52 images.

### Web App and Deployment

This project uses Flask for the web app and its deployment is done on AWS Ec2.

#### Improvements
* Here we've used a very less amount of images to train the model. So, the Model can be improved further by adding more images to the training set. 
* We can add more Classes of Images to help predecting Cars of many Brands.
* Adding more Layers and Epocs into Neural Network will further improve the Accuracy.
