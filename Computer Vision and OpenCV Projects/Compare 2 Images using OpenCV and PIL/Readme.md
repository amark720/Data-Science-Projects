# Compare Difference between 2 Images.

 This is a program in Python to detect the difference in the 2 images (Pre.jpg and Post.jpg) of the same map location. The both 2 images are of same map location but taken on different dates.
 We need to find out those spots on the images where they are differ from one another using OpenCV and Computer Vision.
