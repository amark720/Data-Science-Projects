# Compare Difference between 2 Images.

This is a program in Python to detect the difference in the 2 images (Pre.jpg and Post.jpg) of the same map location. The both 2 images are of same map location but taken on different dates.
 We need to find out those spots on the images where they are differ from one another using OpenCV and Computer Vision.

### Conclusion!
One can examine maps at different scales and make observations about the amount of detail one can see. We can compare satellite images with maps and use satellite images to measure and map changing land use. With the use of Computer Vision this task can be done in less time with a great accuracy.
