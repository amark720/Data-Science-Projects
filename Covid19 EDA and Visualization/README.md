# Coronavirus Data Science
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for investigating the 2019 coronavirus outbreak. The goal is to serve a Detailed Visualization to track and analyze this outbreak. Getting an environment set up to read, analyze, and plot the outbreak data. I am hoping this helps more people get started.

If you are a researcher, journalist, or other interested member of the public, please use this freely. If you are a data scientist, please fork and contribute back to build a better foundation for future research.

## Goals
1. Provide a framework and tools for loading outbreak data into Python
2. Easily visualize outbreak using barchart and Piechart
3. Facilitate collaboration among researchers

The data set used to Visualize the Plots is the Covid19 data set, found here: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset
